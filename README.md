# Student_Concentration_Detection
A computer vision project for detecting student concentration levels using image classification techniques. The concentration levels can be one of the two: engaged and not engaged. Within each category, there are 3 sub-categories available.

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect student concentration levels using computer vision techniques. The model classifies images to determine whether a student is focused or distracted.

## Data
The dataset consists of images of students in various states of concentration. The images are labeled to indicate whether the student is focused or distracted.

## Model
The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify the images. It is trained from scratch using the PyTorch Library. 

## Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model architecture: CNN with transfer learning
- Training and evaluation metrics
- Visualization of results

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 91% on the test set and 95% on the training set. Here are some example predictions:

## Applications
The Student Concentration Detection project has various potential applications, especially in educational and training environments. Here are some specific use cases:
- Real-Time Monitoring: Integrate with online learning platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or Khan Academy to monitor student engagement in real-time.
- Personalized Learning: Provide personalized feedback to students based on their engagement levels, suggesting breaks or additional resources if they appear distracted.
- Teacher Assistance: Assist teachers in traditional or hybrid classrooms by providing insights into which students are paying attention and which might need additional support.
- Interactive Lectures: Enable interactive responses or changes in teaching methods if a significant number of students are detected as distracted.
- Employee Training: Monitor employee concentration during training sessions, webinars, or virtual meetings to ensure effective learning.
